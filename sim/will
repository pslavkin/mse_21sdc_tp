Hi Will, I'm Pablo Slavkin, I spend a couple of days with you on november and signed an NDA after that to work on a motor control firm/hardware for your robots.                                  
Have you decided what to do with that? Still want to join efforts?                               
I'm actually working in Rusia until february, in a high power servo driver board proyect.        
If you were interested in, just let me know and we could find a way.                             
Have a succesfull 2020!
